Hi Bill --  Here is a sample vis5D file using the Chesaepake Bay numerical
model with the included topography file.


FILES:
--------------------
cbt.v5d.Z  :  the compressed vis5d file.  

uncompress like
	uncompress cbt.v5d.Z

the variables are velocity (U,V,W), salinity and kinetic energy.  there are
60 grid files, each file has a volume of each variable;  ie: grid file 1
has a datavolume 75x179x13 of U, the same size datavolume for v, w,
salinity and KE.

CB.TOPO  : the topography file for the Ches. Bay used in the numerical
model.  


NON-CAVE  USAGE:
--------------------

1. call vis5d like 
		vis5d cbt.v5d -topo CB.TOPO

then select TOPO and PERSPECTIVE for the full effect.


2.  start with a horizontal slice of salinity near the surface.  use
the SLICE option and the right mouse button to grab the edge of the
salinity slice and move it up.  use the arrow keys with the cursor in
the colorbar which will appear to adjust the colors for better
contrast.

3.  add a horizontal salinity contour slice just above the salinity color
slice.  change the contour interval to 1.0

4.  select HWIND-1 and move the slice up to just above the preceeding
two slices.  change the density to .5 and the scale to 50 -- this is done
in the small window that pops up when you click the HWIND-1 button.

5.  select ANIMATE and enjoy the show.  disregard the spurious velocity
vectors seen near the offshore boundary -- i'm working on the fix to that.
